## Linear Regression

**Description**:  
Linear regression is one of the simplest algorithms in machine learning. It establishes a linear relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It uses the least squares method to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values.

**Use Cases**:
- Predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.
- Predicting sales or demand based on historical data.

**Code Explanation**:  
In the `linear_regression.py` file, a synthetic dataset is created using `make_regression()` from `sklearn`. We then fit a linear regression model to the data and predict the target values. Finally, the model's performance is visualized by plotting the regression line.

**Key Points**:
- Simple and interpretable.
- Assumes a linear relationship between features and target.
- Prone to underfitting for non-linear data.
## Decision Trees

**Description**:  
Decision Trees are a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They partition the data into subsets based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure. Each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents a prediction.

**Use Cases**:
- Predicting loan approval based on features like income, credit score, etc.
- Customer segmentation and classification in marketing.

**Code Explanation**:  
The `decision_tree.py` file implements a decision tree for classification, using the `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `sklearn`. The decision tree is trained on a dataset and visualized to showcase how the model splits the data at each decision point.

**Key Points**:
- Easy to understand and interpret.
- Can handle both categorical and numerical data.
- Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.
## Neural Networks

**Description**:  
Neural Networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain. They consist of layers of nodes (neurons), where each node is connected to others in adjacent layers. The network is trained using backpropagation, where the weights of connections are adjusted based on the error in predictions.

**Use Cases**:
- Image recognition (e.g., facial recognition).
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like text classification and sentiment analysis.
- Time series forecasting.

**Code Explanation**:  
The `neural_network.py` file demonstrates a basic neural network implemented using `Keras` and `TensorFlow`. The network is trained on a dataset, and the model's accuracy is evaluated using a test set.

**Key Points**:
- Powerful and flexible for complex tasks.
- Requires large datasets for training.
- Computationally expensive and prone to overfitting without regularization.
## Support Vector Machines (SVM)

**Description**:  
SVM is a powerful algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by finding a hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes. The algorithm seeks the optimal margin that maximizes the distance between the classes.

**Use Cases**:
- Text classification (e.g., spam detection).
- Image classification tasks.
- Bioinformatics (e.g., cancer detection).

**Code Explanation**:  
The `svm.py` file implements an SVM model for classification using `sklearn`. The model is trained on a dataset, and the decision boundary is visualized.

**Key Points**:
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
- Works well for both linear and non-linear classification.
- Sensitive to the choice of kernel and parameters.
